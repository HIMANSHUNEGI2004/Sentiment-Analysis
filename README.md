### Sentiment Analysis 

If we want **one best model** that works well across **small, medium, and large datasets**, then **BERT-based models** are the best choice.  

### **Why BERT?**  
âœ… **Handles small, medium, and large datasets well**  
âœ… **Understands context better than traditional ML models**  
âœ… **Can be fine-tuned for better accuracy**  
âœ… **Works for multiple languages and domains**  

However, BERT requires more **computational power**. If you have limited resources:  
- **Small datasets â†’ SVM or NaÃ¯ve Bayes (fast and simple)**  
- **Medium datasets â†’ LSTM (good balance of accuracy & performance)**  
- **Large datasets â†’ BERT (best accuracy, but needs a strong GPU/TPU)**  

### If we have enough computing power, **BERT-based models** are the best for all dataset sizes! ðŸš€
