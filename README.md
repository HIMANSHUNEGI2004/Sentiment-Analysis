### Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment Analysis is a technique used in computers to understand human emotions from text. It helps to show a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral feeling. The goal that Sentiment mining tries to gain is to be analysed peopleâ€™s opinions in a way that can help businesses expand. It focuses not only on polarity (positive, negative & neutral) but also on emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.).



If we want **one best model** that works well across **small, medium, and large datasets**, then **BERT-based models** are the best choice.  



### **Why BERT?**  
âœ… **Handles small, medium, and large datasets well**  
âœ… **Understands context better than traditional ML models**  
âœ… **Can be fine-tuned for better accuracy**  
âœ… **Works for multiple languages and domains**  


However, BERT requires more **computational power**. If you have limited resources:  
- **Small datasets â†’ SVM or NaÃ¯ve Bayes (fast and simple)**  
- **Medium datasets â†’ LSTM (good balance of accuracy & performance)**  
- **Large datasets â†’ BERT (best accuracy, but needs a strong GPU/TPU)**  


### If we have enough computing power, **BERT-based models** are the best for all dataset sizes! ðŸš€
